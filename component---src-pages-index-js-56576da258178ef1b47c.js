We quickly bonded\n    over a shared love of word-related humor. Although our relationship was work-first,\n    we became good friends and often discussed topics not related to work. As Paul\n    began to trust Christine with bigger things in his life, and interest between us\n    grew, we started seeing each other outside of work as well. Totally just social.\n    You know. Eventually, the time came when neither of us could deny how we felt, so\n    we took a long walk, a week of texting, and one fateful Saturday (that would be\n    May 2, 2020—some good things did come out of the crazy year) to decide to embark\n    upon a romantic adventure. Since then, we have been growing in knowledge of and\n    love for one another and Jesus, while enduring the wild circumstances of the past\n    year together.","In November of 2020, Paul prepared a romantic and special proposal that Christine\n    only half-anticipated. He wrote a book detailing the journey of our time together,\n    over-planned a picnic, and coordinated friends to set up the scene and sneak-attack\n    with professional photographs. We had been talking about marriage since a trip to\n    visit Christine's family in July and were overjoyed to be taking public steps\n    toward a future of oneness.",'Engagement has been a very busy season: planning a wedding, buying a house, and\n    going through marriage mentoring with a couple from our church, on top of our\n    regular work and life schedules. We decided to make it even more intense by creating\n    our own website! It has been very rewarding and will be even more so if we only\n    receive positive feedback! In all seriousness, preparing for marriage has been\n    our first "group project," and it is wonderful getting to make big decisions\n    together, seeing each other\'s priorities played out in real circumstances, and\n    thinking about how much cake we get to enjoy on May 8.',"We are so excited to spend our first day as Mr. & Mrs. Paul Spangler with our\n    friends and family. That's you! We appreciate you and are grateful to be surrounded\n    by such an uplifting community."]}))}},"h+IW":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return r}));var a=n("q1tI"),o=n.n(a);function r(e){var t={width:"min(500px, 90%)",fontFamily:"Glegoo",textAlign:"justify"},n=Object(a.useState)([]),r=n[0],i=n[1];Object(a.useEffect)((function(){Array.isArray(e.text)?i(e.text):i([e.text])}),[e.text]);var s="/photo/"+e.src;return o.a.createElement("div",{style:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",alignItems:"center"}},o.a.createElement("img",{style:{width:"min(500px, 90%)",paddingBottom:20},src:s,alt:""}),r.map((function(e,n){return o.a.createElement("p",{key:""+n,style:t},e)})))}}}]);
